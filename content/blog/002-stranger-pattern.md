## The why

The goal of someone in software is quite simple: build things that are fast, intutive and work as expected (whether it is to make or use). In-order to achive the set goals, we tend  to use the newest cutting edge technology. 
It makes sense in theory, latest tech uses the latest browser api's and offset a lot of work to the rendering engine. Eventually (just like the cirlce of life), the library you use, will end up being old (legacy), it will take time to add new code and it will be harder to get new talent that know about the said stuff.  At some point the organization will face the challenge of doing something with the system, they can either continue to use it like a bank(see [COBOL cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL_Cowboys)), do a huge migration or try to strangler your way to the latest and greatest. 

This story is how we got to stranger our way to react from using marionette.
